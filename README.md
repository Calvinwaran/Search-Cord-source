A search engine for archived discord servers. Search-Cord.com

### How to contribute to the Project an archive your Discord-Server

##### Step1: Invite the Bot
[Invite the Bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=965709397928054884&permissions=66560&scope=bot%20applications.commands)


##### Step2: Index a Channel
Now you can go to the channel you want to archive and just use the /index command there.

Thats It :) 



#####  Why did we start this project?

We as 2 guys who program a lot have noticed a problem: On many Discord servers there is an incredible amount of useful knowledge and many solutions for problems. Now it is unfortunately so that you can not find these messages outside of these servers.

#####  The Idea:
We thought that we could develop a bot and a search engine to index the knowledge, archive it and make it easily searchable.

##### The solution:

Search-Cord.com was born exactly from these thoughts. We enable server admins to archive their Discord servers and make the knowledge on them available to everyone. We offer anyone who wants to make their own copy of the archive the ability to do just that through our API. And of course everyone can use the search engine for free

##### Search-engine-privacy:

We do not store data of search engine users.

##### Discord-privacy:

We store the content of Discord messages, the user ID, channel ID, server ID and username. But we only make the message content, timestamp and username public without #numbers via search engine or api.

We save the user ID so that each user can further anonymize his messages with our privacy tool or delete them completely from our database.

The channel and server ID is stored by us so that we can enable our context feature, with which you can see the messages following a message to find possible solutions.

#### Thanks for supporting Search-Cord :D

If you have decided to delete messages written by you from the archive,
you can easily do so by following these steps


First, [click here](https://search-cord.com/login) to log in with your Discord account so we can 
confirm that you are the correct author of the messages.

Once you have done this successfully you can simply visit [this page](https://search-cord.com/removemydata). 
There you just have to confirm that you want to perform this step and 
then your messages will be removed from the archive. We will also store your 
User ID in a blacklist, so that no more messages from you will be stored in the future.
